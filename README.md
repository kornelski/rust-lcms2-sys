# [Little CMS](http://www.littlecms.com) bindings for [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

Makes [LCMS C API](https://github.com/mm2/Little-CMS) available in Rust. There's also a [higher-level wrapper](https://github.com/kornelski/rust-lcms2).

It's up to date with version 2.15, and works with older versions too. Linux, macOS and Windows are supported. Other platforms may work, too.

The crate requires Rust 1.64 or later.

## Differences from [the C API](https://kornelski.github.io/rust-lcms2-sys/)

 * Type names don't have the `cms` prefix, e.g. `cmsColorSpace` is `ColorSpace`.
     * All C function names remained the same (with the prefix, e.g. `fn cmsReadTag()`).
 * Enum values don't have the `cmsSig` prefix, e.g. `cmsSigLabData` is `LabData`.
 * Some arguments use more specific type, e.g. `Intent::Perceptual` enum instead of `INTENT_PERCEPTUAL` integer.

## Dynamic vs static

If `LCMS2_LIB_DIR` environmental variable is set and contains either static or dynamic library, this libary will be used regardless of other settings.

The package supports "static" and "dynamic" [Cargo features](http://doc.crates.io/manifest.html#usage-in-end-products). If "dynamic" is selected (the default) then it will link to system-wide LCMS2 shared library if `pkg-config` is installed and working correctly.

If `pkg-config` doesn't work (i.e. on Windows), or the "static" feature is enabled, it will build LCMS 2.15 from source instead.

If `LCMS2_STATIC` environmental variable is set it will prefer static linking.
